EMI CALCULATOR PROGRAM 
The program is an EMI (Equated Monthly Installment) calculator that allows users
to calculate either simple interest or compound interest based on their input. 
It is designed to be interactive, prompting the user for necessary inputs and displaying 
the results.

Key Features

Simple Interest Calculation:

Formula: Simple Interest = (Principal × Rate × Time) / 100

Compound Interest Calculation:

Formula: Amount = Principal × (1 + (Rate / (100 × n))) ^ (n × Time)

User Interaction:

Asks the user whether they want to calculate interest.
Prompts the user to choose between simple or compound interest.

Looping Mechanism:

The program runs in a loop, allowing the user to perform multiple calculations 
until they choose to exit by typing "no".

Functions

simple_interest(r, p, t): Calculates simple interest using the formula.

compound_interest(r, p, t, n): Calculates the total amount using the compound interest formula.

main(): Handles user interaction, input collection, and function calls.

How It Works

The program starts by asking the user if they want to calculate interest.
If the user chooses simple interest, it calculates and displays the simple 
interest and total amount.

If the user chooses compound interest, it calculates and displays the 
compound interest and total amount.

The program continues to loop until the user inputs "no" to exit.

Corrected output messages to accurately reflect the type of interest 
being calculated.

Ensured the interest rate is converted from a percentage to a decimal 
in the compound interest formula.

This program is a simple yet effective tool for calculating interest, 
suitable for educational purposes or personal finance calculations.
